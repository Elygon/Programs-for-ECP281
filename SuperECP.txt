Question:  Between a nine year old child and a super computer which is more better in terms of intelligence, speed and power

Answer:
1.  In terms of speed the super computer will always be faster than the nine year old child. There's no human that can beat the speed of machines/computer as there are being updated often.

2. Concerning intelligence the super computer is better than the nine year old child, because it's assumed at that age the nine year old child doesn't know more than the supercomputer. But assumption at the same thing is not advisable, seeing we're living in the days of advanced technology that children even at the age of nine are already learning how to operate on devices. Even in china there are children are the age of seven to nine learning how to create the phones we use in Nigeria. If those nine years old children creates these phones then the creator is meant to be more intelligent than the created supercomputer since the creator knows every bit of the computer.

3. In terms of power, supercomputer is more powerful than the nine year old child as the computer has the capacity to run for hours without taking a break beyond humans' capacity specifically the nine year old child no matter what the purpose may be.
